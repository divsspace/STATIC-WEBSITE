# STATIC-WEBSITE
This project involves the development of a static website designed as a comprehensive business directory for local enterprises. Built using HTML and CSS, the website showcases a clean and responsive user interface, providing users with essential information such as business names, locations, contact details, operating hours, and customer reviews. Each business is featured on its dedicated page or section, allowing visitors to easily browse and navigate through different categories. The site layout emphasizes clarity and accessibility, ensuring a seamless browsing experience. While the website does not include dynamic server-side functionality, it effectively organizes and presents business information in a structured manner, making it a valuable local resource for users seeking services or establishments in their area.
